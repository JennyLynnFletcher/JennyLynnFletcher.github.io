It was written by the series’ unofficial continuity advisor Ian Levine and freelancer Fiachra Trench, who had previously collaborated on the theme music for the TV pilot K-9 and Company, a Doctor Who spin off from 1981. When news of the single was announced in early March, it was rumoured that the recording session would include the Village People, together with self-confessed Doctor Who fans Elton John and Holly Johnson.

The resulting supergroup recorded and released the single under the name Who Cares?, with the participation of four regulars from the TV series: Colin Baker (the Sixth Doctor), Nicola Bryant (companion Peri Brown), Nicholas Courtney (recurring character Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart) and Anthony Ainley (the Master). The music was played by Hans Zimmer on a Fairlight II synthesizer; Zimmer was later to have success as a film composer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jenny</name></author><summary type="html">In 1985, when the production of the series was suspended for a year and it looked as if it faced cancellation, a charity single was produced and released in March.
